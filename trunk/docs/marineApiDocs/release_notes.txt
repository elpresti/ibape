Third preview release, not to be used in production. Major API changes may be
introduced in future versions. Released on 2011-05-08.

CHANGES

 * Refactored and moved sentence id parsing to TalkerId and SentenceId enums.
 
 * GSA parser; refactored the satellite data parsing. The values were parsed
   once and cached, which resulted in inconsistency if setters had been used.
   Now, all values are parsed for each getter call.
      
 * SentenceParser no longer uses SentenceId enum to identify different sentence
   types. Plain Strings are used instead, e.g. "GGA" or "GLL", which enables
   extending the SentenceParser and thus creating custom parsers for unsupported
   sentence types.
   
 * Various small improvements and bug fixes.
  
NEW FEATURES
 
 * SentenceReader notifies when data reading and event dispathcing has started
   and stopped.

 * Support for DPT and DBT sentences, i.e. depth of water.
 
 * Support for parsing proprietary sentences (TalkerId.P)

KNOWN ISSUES
  
 * Position.distanceTo() may not produce correct results.
